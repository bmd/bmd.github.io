I saw [a cool article](https://lauris.github.io/text-generation-markov-chain/) about using Markov chains to generate text. Given a large enough corpus to draw from, a Markov text generator will consistently come up with *plausible* assemblages of words. So, what if we fed it some text that barely qualifies as a plausible assemblage of words to begin with...something like the script of Star Wars: Episode III?
