I saw [a cool article](https://lauris.github.io/text-generation-markov-chain/) about using Markov chains to generate text. This simple text algorithm won't pass the Turing test anytime soon, but given a large enough corpus a Markov text generator will consistently come up with plausible assemblages of words. So, what if we fed it some text that barely qualifies as a plausible assemblage of words to begin with...something like the script of Star Wars: Episode III?

[Well, here's what happened.](https://github.com/bmd/markov-star-wars)
