I work with executives, product stakeholders, and software engineers to design,
build, and deliver complex, data-driven software on time and within budget,
using a wide range of tools and technologies. I leverage my expertise in **ReST
API design** and contract-driven development to engineer scalable, performant
services using **PHP** and **AWS**. I’ve contributed to data warehousing,
single sign-on, and API design projects for BSD’s next-generation data products,
while mentoring developers and leading internal trainings and workshops.
