Hey there.

I'm an analytics developer at **[Blue State Digital](http://bluestatedigital.com)**. I write code and build tools that help progressive causes and non-profits succeed on the internet. 

I'm also the digital director at **[Rise](http://risenow.us)**, a non-profit fighting to improve legal protections for survivors of sexual assault across the United States. 

I used to manage a digital humanities project called **[DARMC](http://darmc.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do)** and do **[health economics research](http://primahealthanalytics.com)**. Before that, I lived in **[Kirkland house](http://kirkland.harvard.edu/)** and studied history.
