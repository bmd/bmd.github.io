              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p> I'm an analytics developer <strong><a href="http://bluestatedigital.com">Blue State Digital</a></strong>. I write code that helps good people measure the internet. I used to manage a digital humanities project called <strong><a href="http://darmc.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">DARMC</a></strong>. Before that, I lived in <strong><a href="http://kirkland.harvard.edu/">Kirkland House</a></strong> and studied history.</p>
                <p>I like to talk about things like spatial analysis, early medieval Europe, machine learning, and photography. If you like those things too, you should <strong><a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">say hi</a></strong>. Or, maybe you'd like to take a look at some of the <strong><a class="page-scroll" href="#services">projects</a></strong> that I do in my spare time?</p>
